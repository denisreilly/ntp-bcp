    <section title="Keeping NTP up to date">
      <t>No software (not even NTP) is perfect. 
      Bugs can be present in any software. As software 
      is widely deployed, users find more bugs. And even if software is 
      thoroughly tested and "all" the bugs are wrung out, users continuously 
      find new ways to use software that their authors did not conceive 
      of, which can uncover more bugs. Thousands of individual bugs have 
      been found and fixed in the NTPv4 reference implementation since the 
      first release in 1997.</t>
      <!-- I got that from http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2717320 . -->

      <t>In addition, there are always new ideas about security on the Internet, 
      and an application which is secure today could be insecure tomorrow once 
      an unknown bug (or a known behavior) is exploited in the right way. Many 
      security mechanisms rely on time, either directly or indirectly, as part 
      of their operation. If an attacker can spoof the time, they may be able to 
      bypass or neutralize other security elements. </t>

      <t>In general, the best way to protect yourself and your networks against 
      these bugs and security threats is to make sure that you keep your NTP 
      implementation up to date. The NTP protocol has many different 
      implementations on many different platforms. It is advised that NTP users 
      actively monitor wherever they get their software to find out when updates 
      are available, and deploy them as soon as practical. </t>

      <t>The original implementation of NTP Version 4 is still actively 
      maintained and being developed by Network Time Foundation with help from 
      volunteers. The Network Time Foundation currently maintains the reference 
      implementation for NTP at http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html and also at 
      https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp .</t>

    <section title="General Network Security Best Prectices">
      <t>NTP deployments are only as secure as the network they are running on.</t>
      <section title="BCP 38">
          <t>Many network attacks rely on modifying the IP source address of a 
          packet to point to a different IP address than the computer which 
          originated it. This behavior has been known for quite some time, and 
          <xref target="RFC2827">BCP 38</xref> was approved to address this in 2000. 
          This document calls for filtering incoming traffic to make sure that the 
          source IP address is consistent with the networks that are connected to 
          that interface. It's recommended that all large networks (and ISP's of 
          any size) implement this. More information is availavle at 
          http://www.bcp38.info . </t>

        <t>NTP Mode 7 packets can be used as a vehicle for a Denial of Service

           the following to their ntp.conf file:</t>
        <t>restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery</t>
        <t>restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Using Pool Servers">
            <t>It only takes a small amount of bandwidth to synchronize one NTP
        client, but NTP servers that can service tens of thousands of clients
        can take considerable resources to run. Users who want to synchronize
        their computers should only synchronize to servers that they have 
        permission to use.</t>
            <t>The NTP pool project is a collection of volunteers who
        have donated their compting and bandwidth resources to provide
        time on the Internet for free. The time is generally of good
        quality, but comes with no guarantee whatsoever. If you are
        interested in using the pool, please review their instrutions
        at http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/use.html .</t>
            <t>If you want to synchronize multiple computers using the pool,
        consider running your own NTP server, synchronizing that to the pool,
        and synchronizing your clients to your in-house NTP server. 
        This reduces the load on the pool.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Starting, Cold-Starting, and Re-Starting NTP">
      <t>Only use -g on cold-start. Other things TBD.</t>
      <t>Editor's Note: I think I'd like to expand this a bit to cover how to deal with 
      NTP stopping, when to restart it, and under what circumstances to not restart it!</t>

    <section title="NTP in Embedded Devices">

      <t>Readers of this BCP already understand how important accurate time is 
      for network computing. And as computing becomes more ubiquitous, there 
      will be many small "Internet of Things" devices that require accurate 
      time. These embedded devices may not have a traditional user interface, 
      but if they connect to the Internet they will be subject to the same 
      security threats as traditional deployments.</t>

        <section title="Updating Embedded Devices">
            <t>Vendors of embedded devices have a special responsibility to pay 
        attention to the current state of NTP bugs and security issues, because 
        their customers usually don't have the ability to update their NTP 
        implementation on their own. Those devices may have a single firmware 
        upgrade, provided by the manufacturer, that updates all capabilities at 
        once. This means that the vendor essentially assumes the responsibility 
        of making sure their devices have the latest NTP updates applied.</t> 
            <t>This should also include the ability to update the NTP server address.</t>
            <t>(Note: do we find specific historical instances of devices behaving badly and cite them here?)</t>
        </section>

        <section title="KISS Packets">
            <t>The "Kiss-o'-Death" packet is a rate limiting mechanism where a
        server can tell a misbehaving client to "back off" its query rate. It is
        important for all NTP devices to respect these packets and back off when 
        asked to do so by a server. It is even more important for an embedded 
        device, which may not have exposed a control interface for NTP. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Server configuration">
            <t>Vendors of embedded devices that need time synchronization should
        also carefully consider where they get their time from. There are several
        public-facing NTP servers available, but they may not be prepared to 
        service requests from thousands of new devices on the Internet.</t>
            <t>Vendors are encouraged to invest resources into providing their 
        own time servers for their devices.</t>

          <section title="Get a vendor subdomain for pool.ntp.org">
            <t>The NTP Pool Project offers a program where vendors can obtain their
            own subdomain that is part of the NTP Pool. This offers vendors the
            ability to safely make use of the time distributed by the Pool for their
            devices. Vendors are encouraged to support the pool if they participate. 
            For more information, visit http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/vendors.html .</t>

            <t>TBD</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Anycast">
            <t>Anycast is described in <xref target="RFC4786">BCP 126</xref>. 
       (Also see <xref target="RFC7094">RFC 7094</xref>). 
        With anycast, a single IP address is assigned to multiple interfaces,
        and routers direct packets to the closest active interface.</t>
            <t>Anycast is often used for Internet services at known IP addresses,
        such as DNS. Anycast can also be used in large organizations to simplify 
        configuration of a large number of NTP clients. Each client can be 
        configured to the same IP address, and a pool of anycast servers can be 
        deployed to service those requests. New servers can be added to or taken
        from the pool, and other than a temporary loss of service while a server
        is taken down, these additions can be transparent to the clients.</t>
            <t>While clients are connected to an NTP server via
        anycast, the client does not know which particular server they
        are connected to. And as anycast servers enter and leave the
        network, the server a particular client is connected to may
        change, which can cause temporary problems on the client.  It
        is recommended that anycast is deployed in environments where
        precision synchronization is not required. </t>
            <t> A client also may not have any way to diagnose if an
        anycast server is not functioning properly. It is recommended
        that any anycast NTP implementation include multiple
        interfaces with at least one Unicast address. These Unicast
        addresses should be monitored (perhaps in a peering
        arrangement) so that if one server's reference goes bad, it
        can use the other servers to validate the correct time.</t>
